Version: 2.0.0 (2024) 
Created by: JustSMN   

Welcome to Simple Stopwatch! \
This is my old project, I did it for my own needs and just now decided to publish it. \
This is a very simple stopwatch that works in the terminal and it written by Golang.\
It uses the termbox library. 

How to Use:
1. Install Termbox library: Run the following command to install the `termbox` library:\
   `go get github.com/nsf/termbox-go`
  
2. Run main.go:\
    `go run main.go`
3. And enjoy it!!!ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜šðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‡ðŸ¥°

Features:
- Start/Stop: Press the "Space" to start or stop the stopwatch.
- Exit: Press the "Backspace" key to exit the program.
- Real-Time Display: The stopwatch updates in real-time.
- And that's all. This is the full functionality of my program.

v.2.0.0: \
I rewrote the code, now this program has a normal structure and all the code is not written in one file.
